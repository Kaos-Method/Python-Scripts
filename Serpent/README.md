Serpent

Serpent - A Botnet script coded in Python 3.5.

Serpent is a script that has been coded in Python (3.5+). I started creating this program as one of the first programs I made with Python, so it's been a work in progress for many years. The end goal of the program is to provide security professionals with a tool that allows you to use SSH into a a machine, and record the information in the process of doing so. As I continue to work with this program, it will grow, and more will be able to be done with it. 

Comments, Help, and Suggestions - If you have any imput, please leave a comment. I would love any and all positive contributions. I'm always wanting to learn more. If you do leave a suggestion, please make sure to leave it in Python 3.5+.
